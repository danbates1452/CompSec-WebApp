### Computer Security Coursework

A secure (as possible given the timeframe) PHP web application developed for the 'Introduction to Computer Security' module at the University of Sussex

**NOTE**: The frontend design is deliberately unpolished as it was the backend security features that this coursework was graded on!

Separated into two folders:

- 'back' which is hidden from the user
- 'front' which is presented to the user

The intent being that 'back' is placed in a backend directory that is not visible to the user, and 'front' is placed in a frontend directory visible to the user.
