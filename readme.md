### Computer Security Coursework

A secure (as possible in the timeframe) web application developed for the 'Introduction to Computer Security' module at the University of Sussex

**NOTE**: The frontend design is deliberately unpolished as it was the backend security features that this coursework was graded on!

Separated into two folders
'back' which is hidden from the user
'front' which is presented to the user
